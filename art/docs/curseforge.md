##**Immersive Intelligence** is an addon for Immersive Engineering for 1.12.2.
###Keep in mind, the mod is still work-in-progress. **Many of the planned features are not fully implemented**.

The mod's content is split into 4 categories:

**Data and Electronics**  
This category adds the data system, which allows the player to transmit signals on a network of devices connected through IE-style connectors via packets of variables.   
There are many multiblock machines which allow reading, writing, modifying, transmitting and receiving data, allowing it to be an upgraded, precise version of redstone.   
Many devices from the mod use data as a way of configuring them (like the ammunition production multiblocks or the chemical dispenser) or a way of giving orders (like the inserter, packer and printing press).
Immersive Intelligence also changes the way of producing circuits and adds two new tiers of them - the advanced circuits and the processor circuits.

**Logistics**  
Logistics is a category containing various devices that make item and fluid transfer easier. This includes inserters - robotic arms that can pick up and drop items from block containers, minecarts and even from player's hand tasks.
Skycrates - crates on ziplines, which also can be distributed using minecarts.    
Packer - a machine that rapidly packs items to crates or bullets to machinegun magazines and if upgraded, allows fluid input and output to items and charging or discharging electric items.   
Another important addition are 
This category is going to be expanded in future with a logistics system powered by multiblocks, computers, drones and shelves.

**Warfare**

This category focuses on combat - both defense and offense. Current content includes: a machinegun, the stationary weapon with high firepower, stick hand grenades, an ammunition crate for fast revolver reloading and the artillery howitzer -a heavy, precise, data driven offensive weapon with high range and power.
This category also introduces the **bullet system**. The system allows for producing ammunition (and grenades) made of custom ingredients. Want to penetrate a steel wall with your MG? Apply a tungsten or an uranium core. Want some explosions - use RDX. Maybe you want to burn your enemies alive? No problem, put some white phosphorus into your bullets.
Another part of the bullet system is the addition of block damage. Every bullet can damage a block, penetrate trough it or ricochet off it.
In future this category will be expanded with new weapons, such as the spigot mortar, the submachinegun, the autorevolver, railgun rifle grenades, a heavier, stationary version of the railgun, emplacements - heavier, modular versions of the turrets and finally combat drones and missile silos.

**Intelligence**  
Intelligence is a category focused on espionage, infiltration, sabotage and reconnaissance. Currently there aren't many items in this category, but most important ones are the binoculars and the alarm siren.
In future i plan to expand it to add a modular system which will scan and detect enemies using cameras, radars and connected turrets and the command table.

The mod also expands on ore generation, adding tungsten, platinum and two new nether ores. It also adds a new rotary power system and some equipment, like new drill heads.

**Keep in mind, that the mod isn't finished and is currently in beta.**
