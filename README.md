**Immersive Intelligence** is a Minecraft mod, an addon for Immersive Engineering for 1.12.2. Mod is still in work-in-progress state, so **most of the planned features are not added**. There are four main categories of the mod's content: 

 - **Data and Electronics** - alows the player to transmit signals on the data network via packets of variables, there are many multiblock machines which allow reading, writing, transmitting and receiving data, allowing it to be an upgraded version of redstone
  
 - **Logistics** - great storage and crafting system based on multiblocks, data transmission and drones, it will be customizable while staying as immersive as possible. Includes skycrates!
 
 - **Warfare** - weapons of all sorts - machineguns, submachineguns, autocannons, railguns, chemthrowers, combat drones, howitzers, mines, missiles and much more
 
 - **Intelligence** - espionage - stealth - sabotage - this category contains surveillance devices, such as the Infrared Observer and Tripod Periscope which allow you to spy on other players and monitor the world
 
 The mod also features the new rotary power system.
