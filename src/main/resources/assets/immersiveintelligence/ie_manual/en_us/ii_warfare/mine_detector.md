A mine detector is a tool designed for detecting landmines and concealed explosive devices. 
It originates from an unsuccessful attempt to create an ore detector, but turned out to be a savior tool for the military.

In order to check for the landmine, you have to hold the Mine Detector in your main hand, and point it at a block. The presence of the landmine is indicated by a beep noise, growing in frequency the closer you are to the landmine.
It is also worth noting that the mine detection happens not at your position, but at the one you’re looking at.
