Emplacement Weapons
A Show of Force

# mg0
**Machinegun** Emplacement is the most basic and *cheapest* of all the Emplacements available. It is a reliable choice for dealing with soft ground targets, or light vehicles, when using armor-piercing ammunition.
# mg1
**The Machinegun** Emplacement comes in 3 variants: Default, Heavy Barreled and Water-Cooled, which are identical in function to those present in the infantry version of the Machinegun.<br>Take note, this weapon does not use magazines, bullets have to be provided through the emplacement input port. Due to its limited pitch the MG Emplacement is a poor choice for firing at air targets.

# chem0
**Heavy Chemthrower** is a weapon designed for *close-range* engagements against massed enemies. Similarly to regular Chemthrower, the heavy variant can be filled with various liquids from the liquid tanks.
# chem1
By default it ignites the fluid, but it can be toggled using a data packet. **The Heavy Chemthrower** Emplacement has the lowest range among all of the Emplacements, and is bad at targeting airborne targets.

# flak0
The **Autocannon** Emplacement is a standard, all-rounder option for dealing with soft targets, vehicles and air targets. Depending on the ammo, it can serve as a great standard option for base protection against all sorts of threats.
# flak1
Due to its high velocity and diverse pitch and yaw ranges, the **Autocannon** is especially effective against *airborne targets*.<br>Its drawbacks are a slower rate of fire compared to MG and it’s relatively low magazine size, forcing it to reload very often. It is best to combine it with other emplacements.

# railgun0
**Heavy Railgun** Emplacement is used in precision dependent long range combat. It is best used against vehicles and single targets with high durability. Damage is dependent on the metal out of which the rod is made, or composition of the railgun grenade.
# railgun1
Due to it’s very low fire rate, turn rate, and low magazine count, it is a poor choice for engaging amassed targets. It is required to be paired with other emplacements for better protection.<br>The **Heavy Railgun** possesses a high armor-piercing capability, it is best utilized on armored targets, vehicles and targets behind steel walls. No armor is too tough.

# cpds0
A pinnacle of computer technology, mechanical skill and sophisticated targeting software, the **Counter-Projectile Defense System** is the worst enemy of anything that can fly and the logistics department.
# cpds1
Due to it’s astounding rate of fire, as well as fast tracking and response abilities, makes it almost *impossible* for air targets to evade.<br>Thanks to its advanced targeting system it is the best gun for anti-projectile defense purposes, with the capability to shoot down artillery projectiles in mid air. In order to do that it needs to be linked to a Radar or Observers in order to maximize the chances of successful interception.
# cpds2
The only drawback it comes with is its enormous maintenance cost, due to its high rate of fire. If you’re struggling with providing it with sufficient amounts of ammunition, consider using it as a special, last resort weapon for countering projectiles.

# tesla0
The **Tesla Coil Emplacement** is the bigger and more refined variant of the Tesla Coil. The weapon is a good choice against *soft targets*, who happened to come too close. Thanks to its advanced systems, the weapon can differentiate between friend and foe and deals higher damage in expanded range.
# tesla1
Due to being energy-powered, it does not require ammunition - only a constant supply of electricity. Its drawbacks are a low range of attack and high energy consumption.

# ir_observer0
The **Infrared Observer** is a surveillance device used to detect enemies from afar and share their coordinates with other emplacements. It is considered one of the most, if not the most important emplacement weapon.
# ir_observer1
Using one can dramatically extend the operational range of the other Emplacements, **IR Observers** reveal and communicate enemy positions coordinates via Data on extremely long distances and coordinate a network of connected Emplacements to perform precision focus fire on one target from afar, boosting the overall potential of defense system.
# ir_observer2
It is worth noticing the Infrared Observer can also detect Flares and send their coordinates, which can be used for directly guided precise artillery bombardment.<br>Observers have a limited field of view of 180 degrees, with no ability to turn around once set up and only up and down elevation being possible. This means, one Observer can only cover direction. Observers can turn when a proper data packet is sent to it, take note this requires disassembly and hiding into the emplacement.
