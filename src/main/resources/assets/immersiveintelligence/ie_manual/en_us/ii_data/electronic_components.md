# intro
**Circuits** are one of the most important and commonly used electronic parts. 
There are three kinds of **Circuits**:  
[Basic Circuits](#basic_general) - made using vacuum tubes and redstone  
[Advanced Circuits](#advanced_general) - an enhanced version, which uses [Advanced Electronic Alloyâ„¢] and improved vacuum tubes.  
[Processor Circuits](#processor_general) - the most sophisticated ones, made mainly of silicon in a [complicated assembly process](precision_assembler).  

# blueprints
All types of circuit boards require a specialized blueprint to create them.  
*This blueprint should be designed to* [*match*] *the electronic components and chips that are going to be used in them.*

**Basic Circuits** are the common, primary and cheap circuits. 
Their universal design allows them to be easily [refitted](functional_circuits) to perform simple data operations, 
but their main use is construction of various **Data Devices**, such as 
the [Printing Press](printing_press), the [Arithmetic Logic Machine](arithmetic_logic_machine) and the [Data Input Machine](data_input_machine).

**Basic Electronic Components** are created using a [Nickel Plate](metalPress), [Redstone] and a [Vacuum Tubes](components#2) in the [Precision Assembler](precision_assembler).

**Advanced Circuits** are a more refined version of their predecessor, created using a double-layered circuit board, **Advanced Electronic Alloy** and improved vacuum tubes.  
They have a broad use in [Wireless Data Transfer](radio_station) and **Advanced Data Devices**, such as [Advanced Inserters], [Automated Weapons].

**Processor Circuits** are the most sophisticated and capable circuits in the world. They are created using silicon, advanced
electronic alloy and various other materials in a complicated assembly process.
They work as the electronic brains of [Mainframe Computers], [Drones] and many [Advanced Weapon Systems].
