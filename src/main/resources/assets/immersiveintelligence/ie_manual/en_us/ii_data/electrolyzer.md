With the rapid advancements in chemical engineering the demand for chemicals in industy has skyrocketed. With the new
method of electrolysis and modern technology the demands can be meet on an industrial level.

# 1

The [Electrolyzer] is a machine which uses the electrolysis to split a fluid into two different ones.
It can split water into [hydrogen]() and oxygen.
Brine into chlorine and hydrogen.

To form the multiblock, use a hammer on the heavy engineering block in front of the machine.

It requires electricity to operate.

# 2

The fluid has to be provided to the side of the machine, after the process is finishes the two separated fluids
will be outputted to the front. Although the machine's internal tanks allow storing small amount of the
liquid, consider construction of [tank](tank) for an industrial-scale capacity in storing these chemicals.
