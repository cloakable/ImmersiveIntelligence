The Radio Station is a device for sending and receiving data wirelessly.
Radio stations can only communicate when they are in range (which is **lower** in bad weather), work on the same frequency and when both towers are given enough electrical energy.

# 1
The Radio Station is an advanced multiblock, which means it can be only built using an Electric Engineer's Hammer in a 2-step process. 

In the first stage the multiblock must be built and then a hammer has to be used on the upper advanced electronic engineering block
In the second, energy (trough using the electric hammer) has to be provided to finish it.

# 2
The Radio Station's frequency can be set by using a Radio Tuner. 
There are 2 versions of the tuner with different ranges of frequencies. 

The radio station by default can use only the basic range.
