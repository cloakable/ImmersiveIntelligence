# strong_typing
A [Data Packet](data_main) can contain multiple **Types** of variables.  
Each **Type** excels in [storing] and [representing] a different kind of information: f.e. a **Number Type**, like [Integer](#integer) specializes in storing numbers, and thus mathematical expressions can be performed on it much more straight-forward than, i.e. on a [String](#string) - a **Text Type**.  

This way of storing information is called **Strong Typing** and gives each **Type** a unique purpose.
