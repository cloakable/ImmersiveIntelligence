The Redstone Interface is a bridge between the old but still used redstone, and the new data system. 
It can convert data from and to a redstone signal. Because it's only a converter, the machine doesn't use any power.

The machine consists of several parts, some wirecoils, a bunch of steel plates and few electron tubes, but the most 
important ones are the data input port, on which a connector needs to be placed and a redstone output connector
to which you can attach a wire. In the user interface there are two sections, data to redstone and the opposite. 

After you add an entry, you have to specify the variable letter and the corresponding redstone colour.
